# Understanding the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA)

## Introduction
The **Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA)**, signed into law in **March 2021** and effective from **January 1, 2023**, is Virginia‚Äôs comprehensive privacy law. It gives Virginia residents new rights over their personal data and sets obligations for businesses that collect or process consumer information.  

While inspired by laws like **California‚Äôs CCPA/CPRA** and the **EU‚Äôs GDPR**, the CDPA has unique characteristics and represents the growing trend of U.S. states enacting their own privacy legislation.

## Objectives of the CDPA
The CDPA was designed to:
- Strengthen consumer privacy rights for Virginia residents.  
- Increase **transparency** in how personal data is collected, used, and shared.  
- Establish responsibilities for businesses and data controllers.  
- Introduce stronger protections for sensitive personal information.

## Who Does the CDPA Apply To?
The CDPA applies to **businesses that conduct business in Virginia or target Virginia residents**, and that meet at least one of the following thresholds:

1. **Process personal data of at least 100,000 Virginia residents annually**.  
2. **Process personal data of at least 25,000 Virginia residents annually** and derive **50% or more of their revenue from the sale of personal data**.  

This means many medium to large organizations, especially those operating online, will fall under CDPA requirements.

## Key Consumer Rights Under the CDPA
Virginia residents have the following rights under the CDPA:

1. **Right to Access**  
   Consumers can confirm whether a business is processing their personal data and access that data.  

2. **Right to Correct**  
   Consumers can request corrections to inaccurate personal information.  

3. **Right to Delete**  
   Consumers can ask businesses to delete their personal data collected directly or obtained from other sources.  

4. **Right to Data Portability**  
   Consumers can request a copy of their personal data in a portable, easy-to-use format.  

5. **Right to Opt-Out**  
   Consumers can opt out of:  
   - Targeted advertising  
   - Sale of personal data  
   - Profiling for automated decision-making that produces legal or similarly significant effects

## What Counts as Personal Data?
Under the CDPA, **personal data** is defined as **any information linked or reasonably linkable to an identified or identifiable natural person**.  

Exclusions include:
- Data used in an employment or business context.  
- De-identified or publicly available information.  

The CDPA also defines **sensitive data**, which requires **explicit consumer consent** before processing. This includes:  
- Precise geolocation data.  
- Genetic or biometric data.  
- Data revealing racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, mental or physical health conditions, sexual orientation, or citizenship/immigration status.  
- Personal data of children under 13.

## Business Obligations Under the CDPA
Businesses that fall under CDPA must:

- **Provide clear privacy notices** describing what data is collected, why, and how it is used.  
- **Conduct Data Protection Assessments (DPAs)** for high-risk processing activities (e.g., targeted advertising, selling data, profiling).  
- Obtain **consumer consent** before processing sensitive data.  
- Implement **reasonable data security practices** to protect personal data.  
- Provide **easy mechanisms** for consumers to exercise their rights (e.g., opt-out forms).

## Enforcement and Penalties
- The **Virginia Attorney General** enforces the CDPA.  
- Businesses found non-compliant may face civil penalties of up to **$7,500 per violation**.  
- Unlike the CCPA, the CDPA does **not provide a private right of action** (i.e., individuals cannot sue directly).
