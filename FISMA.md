# FISMA — Federal Information Security Management/Modernization Act  

The **Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)** is a U.S. federal law that requires government agencies — and any organization working with them — to implement strong information security practices. FISMA was introduced in **2002**, and later updated under the **Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014** to strengthen federal cybersecurity readiness.

FISMA ensures that federal data, systems, and applications stay secure against cyber threats through standardized security controls, risk management, and continuous monitoring. It is one of the most important cybersecurity laws in the U.S. public sector.

## What FISMA Is About  
In simple terms:

> **FISMA is a law that forces federal agencies and contractors to protect government data using strict security standards and continuous risk-based monitoring.**

It applies to all federal information systems, including:
- Systems operated by federal agencies  
- Systems operated by contractors on behalf of the government  
- State agencies handling federal data (e.g., Medicaid agencies)  
- Private vendors supporting federal operations  

This means even private companies *must follow FISMA* if they work with government data.

---

## Why FISMA Exists  
The goal of FISMA is to ensure:
- The **confidentiality** of government information  
- The **integrity** of federal systems  
- The **availability** of federal services  
- A consistent approach to security across all federal agencies  
- Continuous, real-time monitoring of cyber risks  

Before FISMA, U.S. government cybersecurity was inconsistent and reactive. The law created a unified process.

# Key Components of FISMA Compliance  

FISMA compliance revolves around the **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)**, which your other repositories already discuss. Under FISMA, every agency must follow the NIST RMF steps.

Here are the major requirements:

---

## 1. **System Categorization (FIPS 199)**  
Every information system is classified into impact levels based on how damaging a breach would be:

- **Low Impact**
- **Moderate Impact**
- **High Impact**

Impact levels apply to three key security objectives:
- **Confidentiality**
- **Integrity**
- **Availability**

Example:  
A public website with no sensitive data → Low  
A system storing healthcare data → Moderate  
A system managing national security data → High  

---

## 2. **Selecting Security Controls (NIST SP 800-53)**  
Once the system category is decided, the organization must select and implement a set of security controls from the **NIST 800-53 catalog**, such as:

- Access control  
- Incident response  
- Risk assessment  
- System auditing  
- Encryption  
- Configuration management  
- Continuous monitoring  

The higher the impact category, the stricter the controls.

---

## 3. **Implementing Security Controls**  
Organizations must actually put the controls into place, such as:

- Multi-factor authentication  
- Role-based access  
- Logging and monitoring  
- Data encryption  
- Secure coding practices  
- Vendor risk assessments  
- Patch management  

Implementation must be documented.

---

## 4. **Security Assessment (Independent Review)**  
An independent review is required to verify:
- Controls are working  
- Risks are documented  
- Vulnerabilities are identified  

This can be done by:
- Internal audit teams  
- Third-party assessment organizations  

---

## 5. **System Authorization (ATO)**  
The agency’s Authorizing Official (AO) reviews all documentation and assessment results to determine whether the system may operate.

They issue an **ATO — Authorization to Operate**, which is valid for 3 years.

If risks remain, an agency may issue:
- **IATO** — Interim Authorization to Operate  
- **DATO** — Denial of Authorization to Operate  

No ATO = system cannot run.

---

## 6. **Continuous Monitoring**  
After authorization, agencies must continuously monitor:

- Logs  
- Incidents  
- Patch levels  
- Vulnerabilities  
- Configuration changes  
- Control performance  

This transforms FISMA from a one-time audit into an ongoing risk management process.

# FISMA vs FISMA Modernization (2014 Update)

The 2014 FISMA Modernization Act made the law more effective by:

- Strengthening DHS authority over federal cybersecurity  
- Requiring real-time monitoring instead of static checklists  
- Modernizing reporting requirements  
- Increasing automation  
- Improving federal government coordination  

Essentially, it updated FISMA to keep up with modern cyber threats.

---

# Who Must Comply With FISMA?

FISMA applies to:

### Federal Agencies  
- DHS  
- DoD  
- NASA  
- Department of Education  
- IRS  
- Environmental Protection Agency  
- And all others  

### Federal Contractors  
Any company that processes, stores, or transmits federal data.

Examples:  
Cloud providers, IT firms, healthcare partners, payment processors.

### State Agencies  
If they receive federal funding or handle federal data (e.g., Medicaid).

### Vendors providing services to federal systems  
Even if they never directly access federal networks.

# Benefits of FISMA Compliance

- Better security posture  
- Reduced risk of breaches  
- Standardized security processes  
- Increased trust with government agencies  
- Competitive advantage for contractors  

Non-compliance can result in:
- Terminated contracts  
- Federal investigations  
- Financial penalties  
- System shutdowns  

---

# FISMA Documentation Requirements  

Organizations must maintain detailed documentation, including:

- System Security Plan (SSP)  
- Security Assessment Plan  
- Security Assessment Report  
- Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)  
- Continuous Monitoring Plan  
- Incident Response Procedures  
- Risk Assessment Reports  

These documents prove compliance and support audits.

---

# FISMA and NIST Frameworks  
FISMA is closely tied to NIST frameworks:

- **NIST SP 800-53** → security controls  
- **NIST SP 800-37** → risk management framework  
- **FIPS 199** → impact categorization  
- **FIPS 200** → minimum security requirements  

NIST provides the technical standards; FISMA makes them legally mandatory.

---

# Real-World Examples of FISMA in Action  
- A cloud provider hosting federal data must undergo a strict authorization process.  
- A university receiving federal research grants must protect research data.  
- A healthcare vendor working with VA hospitals must follow FISMA protocols.  

---

# Practical Summary  
If an organization handles data for the U.S. federal government, FISMA requires it to:

- Identify system impact (Low/Moderate/High)  
- Apply the appropriate NIST controls  
- Test and verify these controls  
- Document everything  
- Get authorization to operate (ATO)  
- Continuously monitor risks  

FISMA is not optional — it is a legal requirement.
