# CIS Controls (Center for Internet Security Controls)

## Introduction
The **CIS Controls** (formerly known as the *SANS Top 20 Critical Security Controls*) are a globally recognized set of **cybersecurity best practices** developed by the **Center for Internet Security (CIS)**.  
They provide a **prioritized, actionable framework** to help organizations protect themselves against the most pervasive and dangerous cyber threats.

Unlike broad governance frameworks such as **ISO 27001** or **NIST CSF**, the CIS Controls are **prescriptive and technically focused**, making them highly practical for IT professionals and cybersecurity teams to implement.

---

## Purpose and Objectives
The CIS Controls were designed to:

- Identify and mitigate the most common cyberattack techniques.
- Establish a prioritized roadmap for cybersecurity improvement.
- Provide measurable, implementable, and verifiable security actions.
- Align technical security operations with broader frameworks (e.g., NIST CSF, ISO 27001).
- Help organizations of any size build resilience against modern threats.

In short, the CIS Controls bridge the gap between **high-level security policies** and **hands-on technical defenses**.

## Evolution of the CIS Controls
The CIS Controls have evolved over time to match the changing threat landscape:

| Version | Year | Key Updates |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **v1‚Äìv5** | 2008‚Äì2010 | Focused on top 20 critical controls derived from U.S. defense experiences. |
| **v6‚Äìv7** | 2015‚Äì2018 | Streamlined controls, aligned with NIST standards, and enhanced usability. |
| **v8** | 2021 | Consolidated from 20 controls into **18**, reflecting cloud, mobility, and modern IT environments. |

**Version 8** is the most current, reorganized to emphasize asset management, continuous monitoring, and automation.

## Structure of the CIS Controls v8
The CIS Controls v8 consist of **18 high-level controls**, each broken down into **specific safeguards (sub-controls)** ‚Äî 153 in total.  
These safeguards are grouped into **Implementation Groups (IGs)** that guide organizations based on their size, resources, and cybersecurity maturity.

### üîπ Implementation Groups (IGs)
| Group | Description | Typical Organization Type |
|--------|--------------|----------------------------|
| **IG1 ‚Äì Basic Cyber Hygiene** | Foundational safeguards that all organizations should implement. | Small organizations or those with limited IT/security resources. |
| **IG2 ‚Äì Intermediate** | Adds depth with more detailed monitoring, access, and defense mechanisms. | Medium-sized organizations with dedicated IT teams. |
| **IG3 ‚Äì Advanced** | Comprehensive protections against sophisticated adversaries. | Large enterprises or high-value target organizations (e.g., finance, defense). |

## CIS Controls vs. Other Frameworks

| Framework | Focus | CIS Relationship |
|------------|--------|------------------|
| **NIST CSF** | Strategic, risk-based framework for managing cybersecurity. | CIS Controls align as technical implementations of NIST functions. |
| **ISO/IEC 27001** | Information security management systems (ISMS). | CIS provides operational detail for ISO security controls. |
| **SOC 2 / SOX** | Data integrity and reporting assurance. | CIS supports technical compliance for confidentiality and integrity. |
| **PCI DSS** | Payment card security. | CIS offers best practices that overlap with PCI control requirements. |

CIS Controls are often used **in combination** with these frameworks to provide actionable technical defenses for compliance mandates.
